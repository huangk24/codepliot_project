# Rock Paper Scissor

This folder contains two versions of a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game:

- `rock_paper_scissor.py` — a console/terminal interactive version (type `rock`/`paper`/`scissor` or `r`/`p`/`s`).
- `rock_paper_scissor_gui.py` — a simple GUI using Tkinter with buttons and score display.

Run the GUI (macOS / Linux with an available display):

```bash
cd "/Users/kai/Documents/Kai/github codepilot project/rock paper scissor"
python3 rock_paper_scissor_gui.py
```

Notes:
- Keyboard shortcuts when the GUI is focused: press `r`, `p`, or `s` to play.
- If `python3` cannot import `tkinter`, install Python's tkinter support (on macOS Python from python.org includes Tkinter; for package managers there are platform-specific instructions).
